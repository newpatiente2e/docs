# GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code from anywhere. It's a great way to get started with the workshop. Follow these steps to create a codespace.

1. Navigate to the [Contoso New Patient App](https://github.com/newpatiente2e/Contoso-New-Patient-App) repo and click the **Code** button, then select **Codespaces**.
1. Select the **+** button to create a new codespace. It will take a few minutes to create the codespace.

    :::tip

    Note, if you already have an active codespace running for the repo, you can select it from the list of active codespaces.

    :::

Congratulations! You have created a codespace. Now you can now continue with the next section of the workshop.
